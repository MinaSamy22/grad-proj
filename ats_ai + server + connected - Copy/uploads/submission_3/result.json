    "result": "Based on the provided resume and assuming a typical job description for a Flutter developer, the percentage match is **very low, likely below 10%**.  The resume focuses heavily on Laravel, WordPress, and Power BI, with no mention of Flutter, Dart, or other key Flutter-related technologies.\n\n**Missing Keywords:**\n\n* **Flutter:**  The most crucial missing keyword.  The entire resume lacks any reference to Flutter development, experience, or skills.\n* **Dart:** The programming language used in Flutter development.\n* **Mobile Development:** While the resume mentions web development, there's no indication of experience in mobile app development, a core aspect of Flutter work.\n* **UI/UX Design:**  Familiarity with UI/UX principles is often expected in Flutter roles. This is not explicitly mentioned.\n* **State Management (e.g., Provider, BLoC, Riverpod):**  Experience with common Flutter state management techniques.\n* **API Integration:**  The ability to integrate with backend APIs is fundamental for app development.\n* **Testing (e.g., unit testing, widget testing):**  Knowledge of testing frameworks specific to Flutter.\n* **Specific Flutter Packages:**  Mentioning familiarity with popular Flutter packages would strengthen the application.\n\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nThis resume is completely unsuitable for a Flutter developer position. The skills and experience detailed are entirely focused on different technologies.  To improve, Mina Samy needs to completely rewrite the resume to highlight relevant Flutter-specific skills, projects, and experience. The current document demonstrates skills in other areas but fails to showcase any capabilities needed for a Flutter developer role.  Adding projects showcasing Flutter skills, even small ones, would significantly improve the resume's effectiveness.\n"
